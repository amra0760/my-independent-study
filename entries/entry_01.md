## Knowing What To Do

It has been the first week of my independent study and it has been both tough and exciting at the same time. Tough because I'm unsure of what to do for the next NINE WEEKS. This might not sound as such a big thing, but (for me especially) if I don't feel passionate about what I'm doing I'm not going to put full effort into it. The result: I don't learn anything, I don't benefit from anything, and my grades end up suffering. So needless to say I was indecisive for my first week (and I still am heading into my second week). My intentions as for **_any_** project I do is to make it useful and usable such as that a non-programmer can use it in their everyday lives. I started off by looking at ideas of certain topics we could learn while keeping my intentions, but then I remembered a friend of mine who was a former SEP senior by the name of Jun who presented his independent study project last year and left a whole auditorium of people _ASTONISHED!_ He did his project using Arduino so I wanted to follow in his footsteps and do the same thing since I also felt that people are most moved with something that they can hold in their hand. 


## Python

#### What's Python? And Why? Haven't you learned this already?
Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly
and integrate systems more effectively. Python might seem like an easy language at first and that's because **IT IS!** Python _is_ one of the easiest coding languages to learn for _NON_-programmers, which is why we learned it freshman year of highschool. Now I know what you're thinking, "Oh, you're taking the easy way out for the next 9 weeks". Well unfortunately that's not the case. During freshman we BARELY scratched the surface with what was possible with Python. So after some researching on top programming languages to learn, I found Python and I saw all the cool stuff I could make with it like Robotics, mathematics  and Science Data analysis and so much more! And the crazy part is that they teach this to both middle schoolers, but __NASA__ also uses it. Which is why I fell in love with it.

## Takeaways 
* Research A LOT!
* Find your Passion and Follow it
* Make sure that it's useful 
* TINKER!

It's completely fine that you don't know what to do at first, that's part of the learning process. However, once you do find something make sure you can be *FULLY* committed. When times get tough and things get hard, if you weren't passionate about it in the first place you won't be passionate enough to keep going and you won't see your goal. Remember to also pick something useful or else no would truly appreciate your project. But most importantly find some beginner code and _TINKER!_ Thatâ€™s how I fell in love with it.
