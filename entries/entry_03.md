# <center> My Third Entry </center>

## Quick Recap

As evident, I'm already behind on my blog entries as I missed blog entry_02, but nonetheless I will perservere and keep going despite this minor setback. As you may have noticed, I have confirmed python as my independent study topic and now there's no going back. This is completely fine by me as I'm willing to tackle this elephant. Anyways, these past couple of weeks I've been just cementing and honing my syntax skills in general. As you may or may not know, but I've already learned some basic Python in the 9th grade so this isn't that new to me. However, this was about 4 years ago and I don't remember a lot of things so I've just been refreshing my mind. Furthermore, I continued to [tinker](#myprojects) with some code and learn more about all the possibilities that I can do with Python. My ultimate goal by the end of this week is to have a basis of my final project completed. It's alright if I want to change my mind afterwards, but I _got to_ start with something in order to keep up with the 9-week timeline since I'm already behind.


## My Projects
* ### [Learning how to get User Input](https://repl.it/@amra0760/PythonUserInput)
* ### [Learning Classes and Methods](https://repl.it/@amra0760/PythonClass)
 


## Some Conflicts
While making my User Input repl, I struggled to find the right syntax on how to receive the user input which is fine, that's why we have google. I googled my problem and I came to several solutions, I experimented all of them to find out which one truly works. I left the ones that did work and took out most of what didn't. Then I went to work on my Classes and Methods repl which was part of a code along tutorial. I found this somewhat irritating since the instructor was skipping through some parts that took a lot of time to make, while I had to take *time* to make these by hand. If this isn't making any sense check out my repl [here](https://repl.it/@amra0760/PythonClass) and you'll see what I mean. There was a lot of methods (reader and writer) that had to be made for each attribute. I was aware of this problem in Ruby as when we were first learning reader and writer methods, but we then learned that in Ruby because of MINASWAN there was a attribute accessor method that made this drastically easier. I tried to save some time by googling to see if there was a accessor method in Python, but unfortunately there wasn't so I had to make everything individually by hand. 

Other than that, I just struggled finding a clear goal of what I want to do for my final product. I find this really important since if I don't know what I'm trying to make, I end up being lost and all over the place in terms of learning the things that are neseccary to making my product. Which is why even to this week, I'm still researching all the projects and the possible things I can do with Python.


## Takeaways 
* Find A Goal
* KEEP TINKERING!
* Being a programmer doesn't mean you know how to code, it means that you can think and google

It's vital that you find an end goal at the beginning of your project building process in order to have some sense of what you're going to be making. If you don't know what you're going to exactly make it's fine, but just have a general idea in order to stay on track. Your idea may or may not change, but you have to stick to it and stay focused. Remember to also continue tinkering as that the most efficient way you can learn by yourself and as old and repetitive as this may sound, *Google is your best friend*. This is repetitive because it's true, part of what we learned last week is that the difference between a non-programmer and a programmer is Googling. There are **_TONS_** of problems out there in the world, so just have the mindset that if you encounter one, you're probably person #1,001 to have the same one and there's a solution somewhere online. You just got to be perseverant and patient enough to find it.
